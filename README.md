# Trigger Word Detection

Trigger word detection is a speech recognition task that enables devices to respond when a specific word is detected. In this project, we develop a system that detects the word **"activate"** and produces a chiming sound. This functionality is similar to voice assistants like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or Apple Siri.

---

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to:

1. Create a speech dataset with both positive and negative examples.
2. Build and train a deep learning model using 1-D convolutional layers, GRU layers, and dense layers.
3. Detect the trigger word "activate" in audio clips and respond with a chime.

This project can be extended to perform actions such as:
- Launching apps.
- Controlling IoT devices like lights or speakers.
- Triggering any event upon detecting the word "activate."

---

## **Dataset Creation**

- A speech dataset is synthesized by embedding audio clips of the word **"activate"** (positive examples) and other random words (negative examples) into diverse background sounds.
- Background environments include settings such as libraries, homes, offices, and open spaces.

The dataset is designed to replicate real-world scenarios to improve the model's robustness.

## **Model Architecture**

The trigger word detection model uses the following architecture:

1. **Convolutional Layer**: Extracts audio features from spectrograms.
2. **Two GRU Layers**: Captures temporal dependencies in the audio data.
3. **Dense Layer**: Outputs a signal when the trigger word is detected.

Below is the model's architecture:

## **Steps to Implement**

1. **Data Synthesis**
   - Create a dataset by combining audio clips of words and background sounds.
   - Label data with positive and negative examples.

2. **Model Training**
   - Train the model using spectrograms of the audio data.
   - Use Keras to implement convolutional, GRU, and dense layers.

3. **Prediction**
   - The trained model detects the trigger word "activate" and produces a chime.
